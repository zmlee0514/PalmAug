## Recognition 
1. Open recognition.ipynb  
2. Execute cells in sequence  
3. Choosing the pretrained model with the dataset and model setting shows in the model name  

> If the pretrained model name contains a prefix "rotation", execting the cell "rotation-based oversampling". Otherwise, do not execute it.  

## Matching algorithm
1. Single: Executing "multi-transform matching" cell without any additional transformations.  
2. Mirror-concatenated: Executing "mirror-concatenated matching" cell.  
3. Multi-transform: Executing "multi-transform matching" cell with any additional transformations you want.
